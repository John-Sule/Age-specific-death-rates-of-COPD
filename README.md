    # TASK - COPD
</p>



The age-specific death rates from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in both the United States and Uganda in 2019. The values are given as deaths per 100,000 people.

Your task is to write a Python script that calculates both the crude death rate and the age-standardized death rate for all ages in both the United States and Uganda for 2019.

Your answers should represent the whole population of each country, and the value should be given as deaths per 100,000 people, rounded to one decimal place.

I carried out analysis and visualization of the data in the above task as stated, with relevant info as available. Also, using the required libraries.
